I'm Val, a currently unemployed aspiring junior front-end web dev.

Right now I'm working on hitting the 350 hours I still need to reach my study goals to become a freelancer.

Please click on the projects on my profile to see some of the things I've made so far.

I'm interested in:

- in Single Page Applications (SPA)
- JAMSTACK philosophy
- CSS hacks & optimizations
- Vanilla Javascript.

Within the next 6 months out to August 2025, I aim to have learned and familiarized myself with React JS and SCSS.

Please reach out to me on this profile via DM or e-mailing me at vala@fastmail.com

Trivia: In a past life I was a EEE student at university, I also used to hack around with electronics, linux distros, defensive cybersecurity and have dabbled in programming in C++ (over a couple of years) and I also used to write (western calligraphy, half uncials/printed).
